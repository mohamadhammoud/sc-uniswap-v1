# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

First version was launched in November 2018 and it allowed only swaps between ether and a token. Chained swaps were also possible to allow token-token swaps.

Here is a sample contract for V1

Try running some of the following tasks:

npm i

npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat test
